# Pactopus Release v1.0.0 Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress for Pactopus v1.0.0, a cross-distribution package management tool. Development follows a feature branch strategy with linear history through rebasing.

## Integration Checklist

### After Each Phase
- [ ] Run full test suite on feature branch
- [ ] Rebase feature branch onto development
- [ ] Merge feature branch into development (--no-ff for clarity)
- [ ] Update this tracking document

### Final Release Steps
- [ ] Complete all phase integrations
- [ ] Final testing on development branch
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
- [ ] Rebase development onto main

## Supported Platforms

### Rolling Release (use native package managers)
- Arch Linux
- Fedora Workstation/Server
- CentOS Stream
- OpenSUSE Tumbleweed

### Stable Release (use binaries/alternate sources)
- Debian
- Ubuntu (all flavors)
- Linux Mint (all editions)
- PopOS!
- RHEL/Alma/Rocky Linux
- Amazon Linux 2
- Alpine Linux
- OpenSUSE

## Testing Requirements

Each phase must include:
1. Unit tests for new functionality
2. Integration tests using Docker containers
3. Clean environment for each test run
4. Platform coverage for at least one distribution from each family

## Notes
- Total estimated commits: ~23 across all phases
- Each commit should be atomic and include appropriate tests
- All merges use rebasing to maintain linear history
- Docker-based testing ensures reproducible results
